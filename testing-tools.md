Contrast Ratio
https://www.siegemedia.com/contrast-ratio
Example to use this tool:
A very low contrast error is found on the last paragraph. The two colors used for the background and foreground need to have more color separation. Contrast ratios can be checked using contrast-ratio.com. Currently the background is #dddddd and the foreground is #777777 which is a ratio of 3.29.
☑️ Just changing the foreground to a darker gray like #444444 would provide sufficient contrast at 7.17.
